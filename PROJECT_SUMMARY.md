# Eco Vault Trade - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Eco Vault Trade is a decentralized trading platform for carbon credits and environmental assets built with FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) technology. The platform enables secure, privacy-preserving trading of carbon credits while maintaining transparency and preventing market manipulation.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **FHE-Encrypted Smart Contracts**
- **EcoVault.sol**: Main trading contract with FHE encryption for secure carbon credit trading
- **CarbonCredit.sol**: Carbon credit token contract with encrypted balances and transfers
- **Verification.sol**: Credit verification and validation system with encrypted scoring

### 2. **Real Wallet Integration**
- **RainbowKit Integration**: Latest version (^2.2.8) with Wagmi (^2.9.0) and Viem (^2.33.0)
- **Multi-wallet Support**: Rainbow, MetaMask, and other popular wallets
- **Secure Connection**: WalletConnect v2 integration for cross-platform compatibility

### 3. **Modern Frontend Architecture**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **shadcn/ui** components for consistent design
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **TanStack Query** for state management

### 4. **Security & Privacy**
- **FHE Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted using Fully Homomorphic Encryption
- **Private Trading**: Transaction amounts and details remain encrypted
- **Reputation System**: Encrypted user reputation scoring
- **Verification System**: Secure credit verification with encrypted scores

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
```json
{
  "framework": "React 18 + TypeScript",
  "buildTool": "Vite",
  "ui": "shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS",
  "wallet": "RainbowKit + Wagmi + Viem",
  "state": "TanStack Query",
  "routing": "React Router v6"
}
```

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
// FHE-encrypted data structures
struct CarbonCredit {
    euint32 creditId;
    euint32 amount;
    euint32 price;
    euint32 carbonOffset;
    bool isActive;
    bool isVerified;
    // ... other fields
}
```

### Environment Configuration
```typescript
export const config = {
  chainId: 11155111, // Sepolia testnet
  rpcUrl: 'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/...',
  walletConnectProjectId: '2ec9743d0d0cd7fb94dee1a7e6d33475',
  // ... other config
};
